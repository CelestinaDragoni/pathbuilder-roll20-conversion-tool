You learn one piece of information that was removed from the target text after its creation. You can instead learn one piece of information from a text that had been destroyed, but you must have a fragment of the text, such as a piece of the cover, a page, or even a clasp or metal fittings.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (6th) The spell reconstructs all missing information regarding a specific topic of your choice.\nHeightened (9th) The spell also reveals information the writer self-censored and didnâ€™t commit to paper.",
