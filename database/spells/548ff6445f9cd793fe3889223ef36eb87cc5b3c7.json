If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage.\n\nCritical Success The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.\nSuccess The target takes full damage.\n\n If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.",
