Each time it takes persistent force damage from spellwrack, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.\nFailure As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12.",
