It can't rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills a cost or the like, and can't be made of precious materials or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (5th) The item is metal and can include common minerals, like feldspar or quartz.",
