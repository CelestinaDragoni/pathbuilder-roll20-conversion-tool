    "description": "You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of miracle can do any of the following things. Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower. Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower. Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell. The GM might allow you to try using miracle to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.",
