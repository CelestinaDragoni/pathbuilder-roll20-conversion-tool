If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\nSuccess The target is unaffected.\nFailure The target is shrouded in murky darkness.
