In addition, the ground adjacent to the target is difficult terrain, and the difficult terrain moves with the target, though the target ignores this difficult terrain with its own movement.Fire The target's melee unarmed Strikes and melee weapon Strikes deal 1d6 persistent fire damage on a hit.Water The target takes on a watery sheen, gaining resistance 5 to fire and a swim Speed equal to its land Speed.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (8th) You can target up to 5 willing creatures.",
