    "description": "You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory's clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.\nSuccess The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of modify memory, unless it identifies the spell.\nFailure During the first 5 minutes of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the Spell to modify a memory once each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory.\n\nAny memories you've altered remain changed as long as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is up, you can't alter any further memories.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (6th) You can cast the spell on a willing target to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50 words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches these omissions with an indistinct haze.",
