    "description": "You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.\n\nCritical Success The creature's movement is not restricted.\nSuccess The creature treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.\nFailure The creature can't move closer to you within the area.",
