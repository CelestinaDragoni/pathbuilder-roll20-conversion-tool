On a failed saving throw, a creature becomes dazzled for 1 round, or dazzled for 4 rounds on a critical failure.\n\n If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, radiant beam attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the target.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1)  The damage increases by 1d10.",
