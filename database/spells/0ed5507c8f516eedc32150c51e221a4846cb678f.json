The target can attempt a Will save when the spell is cast, each time it attempts to interact with or escape the walls, and each time something from outside the walls affects the target. On a success, it disbelieves the illusion and the spell ends.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (8th) You can target up to 5 creatures.",
