For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.\nCritical Failure As failure, and the target takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against your questions.",
