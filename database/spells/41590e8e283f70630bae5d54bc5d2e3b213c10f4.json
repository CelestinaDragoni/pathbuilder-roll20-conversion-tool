    "description": "Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.Lessen a Toxin Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.Reduce a Condition Reduce the value of the target's clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (4th) Add drained to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's doomed value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent doomed condition.\nHeightened (6th) As the 4th-level restoration, but you can reduce a permanent doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.",
