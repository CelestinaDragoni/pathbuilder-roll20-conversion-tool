For 1 minute, the first time per round that the target gains persistent bleed damage, they immediately take that amount of slashing damage as the mantis claws grow off the symbol and rake them.\nFailure As success, but the curse has an unlimited duration.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the DC on the target's flat check to remove persistent bleed damage increases to 20 (15 with particularly effective assistance).",
