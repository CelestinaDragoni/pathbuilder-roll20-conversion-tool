Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so dispel magic and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, restoration, or wish can still counteract the effects.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target spends the first action on its next turn with the confused condition.\nFailure The target is confused for 1 minute.\nCritical Failure The target is confused permanently.",
