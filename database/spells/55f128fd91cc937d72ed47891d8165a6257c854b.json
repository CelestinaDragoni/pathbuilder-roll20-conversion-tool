The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. If the target is unwilling, the effects of the sphere depend on the target's Reflex save.\n\nCritical Success The target disrupts the sphere's integrity, causing it to collapse entirely.\nSuccess The sphere functions normally but has only 10 Hit Points instead of 40.\nFailure The sphere has its normal effect.",
