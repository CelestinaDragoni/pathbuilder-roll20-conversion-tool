A creature other than you that enters the area or ends its turn within the area takes 2d6 cold damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. The crystals scatter and refract light; if a light effect enters diamond dustâ€™s area, any creatures that effect goes on to affect gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against it. While the spell persists, you can activate or deactivate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You can Dismiss this spell.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.",
