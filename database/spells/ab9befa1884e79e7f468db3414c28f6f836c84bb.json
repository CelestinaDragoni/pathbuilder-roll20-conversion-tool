You suggest a course of action to the target, which must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target and can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.\nSuccess The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.\nFailure The target immediately follows your suggestion. The spell has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the base duration is 1 hour.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (8th) You can target up to 10 creatures.",
