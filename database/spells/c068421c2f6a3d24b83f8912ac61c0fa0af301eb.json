It becomes fatigued and takes 1d4 damage each hour that can’t be healed until it quenches its thirst. No amount of drinking can quench the creature’s thirst during the spell’s duration.\nCritical Failure As failure but the creature takes 2d4 damage each hour, twice as much as usual for thirst.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+3) The thirst becomes more unbearable, increasing the damage each hour by 1d4, or by 2d4 on a critical failure.",
