    "description": "You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage. Moonlight ray's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. \n\nCritical Success The target takes double cold damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.\nSuccess The target takes full damage. \n\n If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, moonlight ray attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.",
