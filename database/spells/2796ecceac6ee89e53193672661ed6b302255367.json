If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n\nIf you cast quivering palm again, the effects of any quivering palm you had previously cast end.\n\nCritical Success The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.\nSuccess The target is stunned 1 and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.\nFailure The target is stunned 3 and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by quivering palm.\nCritical Failure The target dies.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.",
