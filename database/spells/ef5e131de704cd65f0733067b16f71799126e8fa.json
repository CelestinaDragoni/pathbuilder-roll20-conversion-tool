Furthermore, the targetâ€™s hands and feet become awkward and uncoordinated, as though it were wearing oversized gloves and shoes.\n\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess For 1 round, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Thievery check. If the target rolls a failure at an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Thievery check, it gets a critical failure instead.\nFailure As success, but the effect is 1 hour.\nCritical Failure As success, except the effect is permanent.",
