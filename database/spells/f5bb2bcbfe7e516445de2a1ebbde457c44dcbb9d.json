    "description": "You wrap the targeted creatures in thin, sickly green shrouds that sap information from attackers. The shroud settles about each target's shoulders, granting a +1 status bonus to AC and a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks, both only while the target is in dim light or darkness.\n\n If a creature deals damage in melee to or touches a cloaked creature, the cloak wraps around the attacker, temporarily connecting the psyches of the cloaked creature and the attacker and violently prying a random piece of interesting information from the attacker's mind. The attacker takes 2d8 mental damage and must attempt a Will save. Afterward, the spell ends for the cloaked creature, and the attacker is temporarily immune to mirecloak for 24 hours.\n\nCritical Success The attacker is unaffected.\nSuccess The attacker takes half damage.\nFailure The attacker takes full damage and is sickened 1. In addition, the cloaked creature gleans a piece of information from the attacker's mind. The details and extent of this information are at the GM's discretion.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the attacker takes double damage and is sickened 2.",
