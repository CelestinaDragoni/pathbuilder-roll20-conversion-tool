    "description": "You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures. The impressive roar grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, roar of the wyrm is a fear effect.\n\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected.\nSuccess The creature is frightened 1.\nFailure The creature is frightened 2.\nCritical Failure The creature is frightened 3 and fleeing for 1 round.\n\n Roar of the wyrm affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the draconic instinct, a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the dragon trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way.",
