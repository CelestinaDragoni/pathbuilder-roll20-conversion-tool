This works like summon animal, except you summon a common creature that has the celestial trait and whose level is 5 or lower, such as those below. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of celestials, even if their alignments match.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (6th) Level 7.\nHeightened (7th) Level 9.\nHeightened (8th) Level 11.\nHeightened (9th) Level 13.\nHeightened (10th) Level 15.\nLevel 1 CelestialsCassisian (NG), Lantern Archon (LG), Lyrakien (CG), Silvanshee (NG)Level 4 CelestialsGancanagh (CG), Horned Archon (LG), Hound Archon (LG)Level 6 CelestialsBralani (CG), Choral (NG), Vulpinal (NG)Level 7 CelestialsLegion Archon (LG), Lillend (CG)Level 8 CelestialsBalisse (NG), Procyal (NG)Level 9 CelestialsGaruda (CG)Level 10 CelestialsMovanic Deva (NG), Shield Archon (LG)Level 12 CelestialsMonadic Deva (NG)Level 13 CelestialsGhaele (CG)Level 14 CelestialsAstral Deva (NG), Peri (CG), Trumpet Archon (LG)",
