    "description": "You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each time you Sustain the Spell.Bind (attack) The rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target Escapes against your spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)Coil The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.Crawl The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.Knot The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.Loop The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.Tie The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.Undo The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of rope.",
