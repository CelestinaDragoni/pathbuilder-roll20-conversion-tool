    "description": "The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as see invisibility, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use Command an Animal on the target as part of Sustaining this Spell. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you Cast this Spell.",
