    "description": "You inundate the area with concentrated positive energy, which scours away the stain of undeath. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 positive damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. Creatures that fail the save also take 1d8 persistent positive damage. Creatures that take persistent positive damage from scouring pulse are wreathed in a heatless halo of light. They emit bright light in a 5-foot radius preventing them from being concealed; if the creature is invisible, they're concealed while affected by scouring pulse, rather than being undetected.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (8th)  The positive damage increases to 9d8 damage, and the persistent positive damage increases to 2d8. Creatures remain suffused in light for 1d4 additional rounds after removing the persistent positive damage.",
