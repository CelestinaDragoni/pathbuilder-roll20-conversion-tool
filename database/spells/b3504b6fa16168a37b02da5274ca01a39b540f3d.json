Targets of this spell must be able to see, hear, or otherwise understand you. The targets must attempt a Will save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target becomes mildly distracted by your display and applauds while it isn't fully occupied. It can't use reactions.\nFailure The target applauds you so vigorously that it can't use reactions and is slowed 1. The applause is so involved that it has the manipulate trait. This triggers reactions based on the manipulate trait at the start of the target's turn.\nCritical Failure As failure, plus the target is so distracted by its vigorous applauding of you that it's fascinated with you.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (6th) You can target up to 10 creatures.",
