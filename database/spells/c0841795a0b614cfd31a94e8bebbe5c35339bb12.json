If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends after the hostile action is completed.\n\n While exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (5th) The duration increases to 1 hour.",
