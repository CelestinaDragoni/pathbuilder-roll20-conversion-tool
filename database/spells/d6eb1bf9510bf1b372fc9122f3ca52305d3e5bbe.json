Once you enter the first tree, you instantly know the rough locations of other sufficiently large trees of the same species within range and can exit from the original tree, if you prefer. You can't carry extradimensional spaces with you; if you attempt to do so, the spell fails.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (6th) The tree you exit can be up to 50 miles away.\nHeightened (8th) The tree you exit can be up to 500 miles away.\nHeightened (9th) The tree you exit can be anywhere on the same planet.",
