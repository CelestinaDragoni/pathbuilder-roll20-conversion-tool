Duplicate any non-arcane spell of 7th level or lower. Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell. The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.",
