After the spell, your head sews back together as if it had never split apart. You gain temporary Hit Points for 1 minute equal to half the piercing damage the target takes.\n\n If you are a gug, increase the piercing damage by 2d6 and increase the persistent bleed damage you deal on a critical hit by 1d8. This spell doesn’t alter a gug’s appearance.\n\nCritical Success The creature takes double damage and 1d8 persistent bleed damage.\nSuccess The creature takes full damage.\nFailure You miss and the creature takes no damage.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The piercing damage increases by 2d6, and the persistent bleed damage on a critical increases by 1.",
