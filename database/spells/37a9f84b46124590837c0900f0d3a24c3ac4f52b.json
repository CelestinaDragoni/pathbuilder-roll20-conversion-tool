The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.\nFailure The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.",
