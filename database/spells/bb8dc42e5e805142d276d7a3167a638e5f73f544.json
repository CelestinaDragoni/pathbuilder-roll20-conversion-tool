The effect depends on its Will save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is stunned 1 as it fights off your commands.\nFailure You control the target. It gains the controlled condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.\nCritical Failure As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (10th) The duration is unlimited.",
