    "description": "You call a tiny star to orbit a creature in a sparkling halo before shooting up into the heavens, where it marks the creature’s rough location. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is dazzled for 1 round.\nFailure The target is dazzled for 1 round. While the spell persists, as long as you can see the night sky and the target is visible from the same night sky, you can sense the approximate direction and distance to the creature by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This is exact enough to track the creature, but not pinpoint their exact square (for instance, to make an attack). You can set a number of zenith stars equal to your Wisdom modifier; if you exceed this number, your oldest zenith star is automatically Dismissed.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the target is blinded for 1 round.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The duration increases by 1 day.\nHeightened (4th) You ignore the concealed condition against targets marked by zenith star.",
