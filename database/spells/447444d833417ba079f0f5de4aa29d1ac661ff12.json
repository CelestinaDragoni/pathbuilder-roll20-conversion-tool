You deal 5d6 cold damage, plus 5d6 evil damage if the target is a celestial.\n\n If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, chilling darkness attempts to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.\n\nCritical Success The target takes double damage.\nSuccess The target takes full damage.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the evil damage against celestials increases by 2d6.",
