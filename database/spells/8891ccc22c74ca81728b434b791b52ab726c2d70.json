The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 round.\nFailure The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and drained 1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the creature is permanently enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as restoration can reduce or remove these conditions).",
