If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is stunned 1 as it fights off your commands.\nFailure The target becomes controlled by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature.",
