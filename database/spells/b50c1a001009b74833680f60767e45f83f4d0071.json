Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the effect for that creature.Prismatic Spray 1d8ColorSaveEffects (Traits) 1RedReflex50 fire damage (fire) 2OrangeReflex60 acid damage (acid) 3YellowReflex70 electricity damage (electricity) 4GreenFortitude30 poison damage and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute (poison) 5BlueFortitudeAffected as if by flesh to stone 6IndigoWillConfused, as the warp mind spell (mental) 7VioletWillSlowed for 1 minute; if a critical failure, sent to another plane, as plane shift (teleportation) 8Potent beam-Affected by two beams - roll twice, rerolling any duplicates or results of 8",
