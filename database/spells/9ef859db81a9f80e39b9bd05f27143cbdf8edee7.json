If the target is willing, it can choose to take the effects of critical failure.\n\nCritical Success The target receives the benefit of a successful save against the lowest-level disease affecting it.\nSuccess The target is unaffected.\nFailure One randomly chosen disease affecting the target fills the air in a 15-foot emanation centered on the target. For the spellâ€™s duration, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the area is exposed to that disease.\nCritical Failure As failure, except the miasma contains all the diseases affecting the target.",
