Select a single square within range that is not hazardous or occupied by a creature. The target is drawn to the selected location, becoming euphoric upon arrival. The target must attempt a Will save.\n\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is distracted by the tantalizing scents, becoming stupefied 1 for 1 round.\nFailure The target is stupefied 2 and moves toward the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way.\nCritical Failure The target is stupefied 4 and moves to the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way. If the creature reaches the destination, it must remain in that location for 1d4 rounds but can otherwise act normally.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) You target 1 additional creature, selecting a different square within range as their destination.",
