    "description": "You call upon the spirits of the soil to twist and churn, transforming the terrain in the targeted area into a sodden mess. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.\n\nSuccess The creature is unaffected.\nFailure The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes flat-footed. These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the penalty to Speeds (except Swim speed) is –15 feet.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (3rd) The range increases to 60 feet, and the area increases to a 20-foot burst.",
