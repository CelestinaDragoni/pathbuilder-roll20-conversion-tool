Your words deal 2d6 persistent fire damage, and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target takes half the persistent fire damage.\nFailure The target becomes frightened 1 and takes the full persistent fire damage.\nCritical Failure The target becomes frightened 2 and takes double the persistent fire damage.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) You can target two additional creatures, and the persistent damage increases by 2d6.",
