You deal 8d4 negative damage to the target.\n\n If the target takes damage, its blood flows into your mouth. If you're a living creature and don't have negative healing, you're sickened 2. If you're undead (or living but have negative healing), you can choose to either gain temporary Hit Points equal to half of the negative damage the target takes (after applying resistance and the like) and become quickened for 1 round, or forgo the temporary Hit Points and become quickened for 1 minute. You can use this extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d4.",
