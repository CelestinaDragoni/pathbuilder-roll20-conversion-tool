    "description": "You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs. You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.\nSuccess The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.\nFailure The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (9th) You can target up to 10 creatures.",
