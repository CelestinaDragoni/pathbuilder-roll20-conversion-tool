The target must attempt a Reflex save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target takes a â€“2 status penalty to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.\nFailure As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.\nCritical Failure As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.",
