You gain the following reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends, and you become temporarily immune to lucky number until the next time you make your daily preparations.\n\n That's My Number!     (divination, fortune) Trigger You roll your lucky number as your d20 result on a non-secret attack roll, saving throw, or skill check; Effect You call upon the fortune stored within your lucky number and reroll the triggering check. However, pushing your luck has a price: if your result on the reroll is the same number again, you critically fail, regardless of what degree of success you ordinarily would have received.",
