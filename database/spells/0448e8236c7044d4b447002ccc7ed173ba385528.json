On your next Strike with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a striking rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the striking rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).\n\nIf the target weapon leaves your possession, weapon surge immediately ends.",
