    "description": "A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 negative damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary HP equal to the negative damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target takes half damage.\nFailure The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is immobilized by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.\nCritical Failure The target takes double damage and is immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The piercing and negative damage increase by 1d4 each.",
