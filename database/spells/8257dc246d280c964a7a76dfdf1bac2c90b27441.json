This brand can’t be hidden, but it is visible only to followers of your faith, who see it as clearly as a lit torch. Followers of your faith ignore the target’s concealed condition, if any, and the target gains a –1 status penalty to AC against attacks by followers of your faith. If the target is a follower of your deity in good standing, the spell fails.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The spell lasts for 1 round.\nFailure The spell lasts for 1 minute.\nCritical Failure The spell has an unlimited duration.",
