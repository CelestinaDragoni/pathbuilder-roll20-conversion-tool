    "description": "You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying works like clairvoyance, except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for teleport and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.\n\n The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.\n\nCritical Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.\nSuccess The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.\nFailure The spell succeeds.\nCritical Failure The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.",
