    "description": "Divine power wards the targets, granting each a +1 status bonus to AC and saves while in the area.\n\n Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by—and effects created by—creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the controlled condition on a target of your divine aura, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your divine aura.\n\n When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute. It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, the divine aura's radius grows 10 feet.",
