    "description": "You gradually manifest your spiritual energy into your cupped hands before firing off a storm of bolts and beams that deal 4d4 force damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line. Creatures in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, they're also blinded for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, inner radiance torrent attempts to counteract the darkness.\n\n     (somatic, verbal) The line is 60 feet long. \n    (material, somatic, verbal) The line is 120 feet long. \nTwo Rounds The line is 120 feet long. If you spend 3 actions casting the spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you choose to do so, the damage dealt by this spell increases by 4d4, and you enter a shining state for 1 minute, causing you to glow with light and deal 1 force damage to creatures that end their turn adjacent to you.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The initial damage, as well as the additional damage for the 2-round casting time, each increase by 4d4, and the damage to adjacent creatures dealt while in your shining state increases by 1.",
