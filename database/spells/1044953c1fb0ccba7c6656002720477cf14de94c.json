    "description": "You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground. For the duration of the spell, you can move the target up or down 10 feet with a single action, which has the concentrate trait. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.",
