A creature that wants to gain the benefit of this spell and doesn't care about its limitations can voluntarily fail the save. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all your litanies for 1 minute.\n\nSuccess The target is unaffected.\nFailure The target gains a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. The target can't Aid other creatures, consider any creature an ally, or use spells or abilities that directly benefit another creature (as determined by the GM), even if they also benefit the target. Other creatures allied with the spell's target can still consider the target an ally and affect it accordingly.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (8th) The status bonus increases to +3.",
