    "description": "You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering. The target is flat-footed, takes a â€“2 status penalty to purely auditory Perception checks, and must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to use auditory abilities or verbal spell components. Similarly, a creature who attempts to affect the target with an auditory effect must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.\n\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected.\nSuccess The duration is 1 round.\nFailure The duration is 3 rounds.\nCritical Failure The duration is 1 minute.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (7th) You can target up to five creatures.",
