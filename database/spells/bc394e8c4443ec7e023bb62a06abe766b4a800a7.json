Choose one type of damage from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, slashing, or sonic. The effect is based on the target's Fortitude save.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target gains weakness 2 to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.\nFailure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. If the creature is reduced to 0 HP by the chosen damage and its level is 7 or less, it dies.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) The weakness increases by 1, and the maximum level of creature that can be automatically killed increases by 4.",
