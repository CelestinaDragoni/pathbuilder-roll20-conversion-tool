While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.\nCritical Failure As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.",
