The effects are determined by its Will save.\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target takes half damage.\nFailure The target takes full damage; if the target can cast divine spells, it's stupefied 1 for 1 round.\nCritical Failure The target takes double damage, is stupefied 1 for 1 round, and can't cast divine spells for 1 round.\n\n To many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own deity without significant cause is anathema.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6 (or by 2d8 if the target is a divine spellcaster).",
