Though this spell has the linguistic trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 week, and learns your true name.\nSuccess The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 day, and learns a fragment of your true name (see the Fragmentary Names sidebar).\nFailure The target does as you command. The spell has a duration of 10 minutes, or until the target has completed a finite instruction or the instructions become self-destructive. The creature is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 hour.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.",
