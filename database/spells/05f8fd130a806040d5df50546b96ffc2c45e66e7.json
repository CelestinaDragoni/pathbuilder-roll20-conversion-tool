This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.\n\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected.\nSuccess The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round.\nFailure The target is slowed 1 for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the target is also stunned 3.",
