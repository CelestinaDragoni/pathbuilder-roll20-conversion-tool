On a critical hit, treat the save result as one degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder; its gear remains.\n\n An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of Hardness, unless it's an artifact or similarly hard to destroy. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. This automatically destroys any force construct, such as a wall of force.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d10.",
