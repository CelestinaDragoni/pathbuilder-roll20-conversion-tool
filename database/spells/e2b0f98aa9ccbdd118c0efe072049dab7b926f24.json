You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater.

The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain.\n\n A creature that moves through the area takes 3 piercing damage for every square of that area it moves into.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) The initial piercing damage increases by 3d6, and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.",
