If the target is a non-skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra 2d6 persistent piercing damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n\nCritical Success The worms writhe away harmlessly and the target takes no damage.\nSuccess The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.\nFailure The target takes full initial and persistent damage and is flat-footed due to the pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the target takes double the initial damage and is also slowed 1 by the pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (+2) The initial and persistent damage increase by 2d6 and 1d6, respectively.",
