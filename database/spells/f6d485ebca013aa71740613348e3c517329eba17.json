If you cast this spell on your familiar, your familiar adds your spellcasting ability modifier on checks to Recall Knowledge with the Lore skill of your choice, much like it does for Acrobatics and Stealth. Your familiar must have the speech familiar ability in order to share any information it learns with you. If you cast this spell on your eidolon, it instead becomes trained in the Lore skill.\n\n If you lose physical contact with the target, its connection to the Akashic Record is severed and timely tutor immediately ends.",
