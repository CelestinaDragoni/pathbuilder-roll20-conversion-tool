Instead of counteracting the illusion, you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against an illusory disguise spell, you see the creature's true form but illusory disguise doesn't end).\n\n The area moves with you for the duration of the spell, and the GM attempts a secret counteract check each time a new illusion is within the area.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (7th) You can allow everyone to see through illusions you succeed against, not just yourself.",
