The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.\n\n When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.\n\nSuccess The creature is unaffected.\nFailure The creature becomes frightened 2 before using its action.\nCritical Failure The creature becomes frightened 2, and its action fails and is wasted.\n\n------\n\nHeightened (8th) You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.",
