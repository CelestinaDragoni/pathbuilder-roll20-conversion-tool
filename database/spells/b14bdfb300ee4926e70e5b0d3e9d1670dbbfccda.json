You can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the stone, and you can cast spells while in the stone as long as they don't require line of effect beyond the stone.\n\n Significant physical damage to the stone while you are inside it expels you and deals 10d6 damage to you. Passwall expels you without dealing damage and ends meld into stone. You can Dismiss this spell.",
