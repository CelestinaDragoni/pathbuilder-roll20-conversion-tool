    "description": "You lash a target with tendrils of shadow that steal some of its substance, making it quasi-real. As long as it is quasi-real, its Strikes deal half damage, it can't critically succeed at any skill check, and creatures attempting saving throws against its spells and effects get a result one degree of success better than they rolled. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target is quasi-real until the end of its next turn.\nFailure The target is quasi-real for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt another Will save, ending the spell on a success.\nCritical Failure The target is quasi-real for an unlimited duration.",
