Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nHealing: A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.Manipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait.
