    "description": "With a stern call, carefully chosen barb, or some other challenging declaration, you demand your foe's attention in a duel. Choose an opponent within 30 feet who you can perceive and can hear you, and make your choice of a Deception or Intimidation check against the target's Will DC. No matter the result of the check, the foe is temporarily immune to your Pistolero's Challenge until noon the next day.\n\nSuccess Both you and the opponent gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with Strikes made against each other. If you're a master in the skill you used for the check, the status bonus to damage rolls increases to +3, and if you're legendary, it increases to +4. \nYou can have only one challenge in effect at a time; challenging a new opponent ends this effect on any current target. Otherwise, the effect lasts until one of you is defeated, flees, or the encounter ends.\nCritical Failure You become frightened 1 and can't use this ability again for 1 minute.Pistolero's Challenge Leads To...\n\nCome at Me!TraitsAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.\n\nFlourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.Linguistic: An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.Mental: A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.",
