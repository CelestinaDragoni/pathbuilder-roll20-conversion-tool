    "description": "You grasp the animating force within an undead creature and bend it to your will. If the next action you use is to cast harm targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of that harm spell. Instead of harm’s normal effects, the target becomes controlled by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level – 3. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else’s command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.\nSuccess The target is unaffected.\nFailure The undead creature becomes a minion under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.Command Undead Leads To...\n\nImproved Command UndeadTraitsConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.Controlling UndeadControlled undead gain the minion trait. Minions can use 2 actions per turn and can’t use reactions. A minion acts on your turn in combat when you spend an action to issue it verbal commands (this action has the auditory and concentrate traits). If given no commands, undead minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for at least 1 minute, mindless undead minions don’t act, and intelligent ones act as they please. You can’t have more than four undead minions at a time.",
