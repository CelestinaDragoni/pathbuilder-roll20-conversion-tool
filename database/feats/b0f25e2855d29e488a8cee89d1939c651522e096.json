    "description": "You've learned to attract, quell, and purify spirits, housing them in a special receptacle called a spirit dwelling until they're ready to move on. Through the power of prayers or ritual incantations, one mundane object in your possession becomes a spirit dwelling. Your spirit dwelling functions as a lure for lost spirits weakened by their time on the Material Plane. Each day during your daily preparations, your spirit dwelling attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your spirit dwelling contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your spirit dwelling around an area and attract another wisp. You can also capture stronger spirit remnants from vanquished undead spirits, as explained in the Spirit Dwellings and Remnants sidebar. As long as your spirit dwelling contains any spirits, it glows faintly, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\n As an exorcist, you do more than just collect spirits: you also help rid them of their burdens and lingering resentments, aiding their transition from the Material Plane. Every day, before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps and remnants remaining within your spirit dwelling from the previous day are purified and can join the River of Souls in their final journey to Pharasma's Boneyard.\n\n You can also learn abilities that let you purify a spirit in your spirit dwelling immediately in a cathartic surge, granting you a helpful effect as they depart for the afterlife. Any actions you gain from the exorcist archetype gain either the divine or occult trait, depending on whether you used Occultism or Religion to qualify for Exorcist Dedication.\n\n Spirit's Mercy is the simplest of the purifications.\n\n Spirit's Mercy     (necromancy) Trigger You take positive or negative damage, or you take any type of damage caused by a haunt, ghost, or other incorporeal undead; Cost 1 spirit wisp or remnant; Effect You purify a spirit by having it perform a final act of mercy to lessen the damage caused by another spirit. This grants you resistance to positive and negative damage (or resistance to all damage if caused by a haunt or incorporeal undead) against the triggering effect. If you expend a spirit wisp, the resistance is equal to twice your level. If you expend a spirit remnant, the resistance is equal to three times the level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the exorcist archetype.Exorcist Dedication Leads To...\n\nCast Out, Enticing Dwelling, Spirit's Absolution, Spirit's AnguishTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.",
