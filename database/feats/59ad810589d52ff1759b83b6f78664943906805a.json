    "description": "You gain the services of an undead companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. The rules for undead companions are under Undead Companions and utilize those for animal companions.\n\n Contrary to the usual rules for companions, as an undead master it's possible for you to have more than one undead companion at a time. However, only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and encounters; the rest are reduced to an “inactive” state that can be easily tucked into an inventory or stored in a nearby crypt. If you ever have more than one undead companion, you gain the Call Companion action, with your undead companions taking the place of animal companions.Call Companion Exploration\nSource Advanced Player's Guide pg. 160 2.0\n\n------\n\nYou spend 1 minute calling for a different animal companion, switching your active companion for another of your animal companions.\n\n------\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the undead master archetype.Undead Master Dedication Leads To...\n\nGuardian Ghosts, Their Master's CallTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.Uncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
