    "description": "You fold your spell into a seed. If your next action is to Cast a Spell using 1 action or 2 actions, the spell instead plants itself in an adjacent square. You must make all decisions regarding the spell at the time you cast it. Within the next 10 minutes, you can direct your sown spell to sprout and produce the spell's effects as a reaction, which is triggered when a creature enters the sown spell's space or a square adjacent to it. You can have only one sown spell at a time, and if you don't trigger the spell within 10 minutes, it dissipates and the spell is lost. A creature can notice the sown spell with a successful Perception check against your spell DC.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
