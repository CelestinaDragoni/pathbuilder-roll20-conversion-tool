If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can sustain yourself on dirt and ash instead of normal food and water.Traits\n\nLineage: A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.\n\nOread: Oreads are planar scions descended from shaitans.",
