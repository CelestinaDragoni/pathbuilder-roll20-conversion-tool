    "description": "You call upon your Cascade Bearer training to help you adjust a spell for the current situation. Until the end of your turn, you gain a single metamagic feat from the druid class or the wizard class that has a level requirement of no more than half your level.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
