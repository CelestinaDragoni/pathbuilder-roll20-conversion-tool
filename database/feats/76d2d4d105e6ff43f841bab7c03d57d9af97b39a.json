Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.\n\n Though you can choose any of these, the damage type typically matches a fiend associated with your bloodline. For instance, a hellspawn might choose resistance to fire, or a pitborn with a vrock ancestor might choose resistance to electricity.Traits\n\nTiefling: A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage.
