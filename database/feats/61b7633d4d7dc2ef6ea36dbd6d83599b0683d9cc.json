You gain a 1st-level feat that requires that muse, and your muse is now also a muse of that type, allowing you to take feats with the other muse as a prerequisite. You don’t gain any of the other effects of the muse you chose.\n\nSpecial You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must choose a different type of muse other than that of your own.",
