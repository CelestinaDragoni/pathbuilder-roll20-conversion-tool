A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.Knights in TrainingSource Legends pg. 68\nThe following feats represent benefits of training from the Iomedars (Kalabrynne for knight vigilant, Clarethe for knight reclaimant, either for Lastwall sentry).\n\nRelated Feats: Rescuer's Press, Shall Not Falter, Shall Not Rout",
