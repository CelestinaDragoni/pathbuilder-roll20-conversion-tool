Each ally presently benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat reduces their current frightened condition by 1 and can choose to immediately attempt a new saving throw against any one mental effect currently affecting them. Regardless of the result, any ally that attempts a save is temporarily immune to Wave the Flag for 10 minutes.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nEmotion: This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.Flourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.Mental: A mental effect can alter the target's mind.
