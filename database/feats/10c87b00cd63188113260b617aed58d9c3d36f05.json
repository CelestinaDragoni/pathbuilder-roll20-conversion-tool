    "description": "You can speak to inanimate objects, finding a magical spark within them similar to the one that animated you. You can cast stone tell once per day as an arcane innate spell, but instead of speaking with natural or worked stone, you speak with toys, statues, or other three-dimensional inanimate objects crafted to mimic a creature's appearance, regardless of their composition. The GM has discretion over which objects you can speak with and what they know, although objects generally have a good opinion of those who have cared for them and a poor opinion of those who have neglected or ignored them.Traits\n\nPoppet: Small constructs originally designed to serve as companions or servants. They occasionally gain a greater spark of life, transforming them into independent, sapient creatures.\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.",
