An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.Divine: This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.Emotion: This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.Enchantment: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.Fear: Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.Mental: A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.",
