This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. If this Strike is successful, combine the damage from the attack with the damage from your ally's attack for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.",
