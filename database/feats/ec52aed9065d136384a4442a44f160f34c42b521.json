    "description": "Your ranged attacks push your foes away from your allies. Make a ranged Strike, adding the following effects in addition to the normal effects of the Strike.\n\nCritical Success The target is pushed 10 feet away from you.\nSuccess The target is pushed 5 feet away from you.\nFailure The target is flat-footed for 1 round.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAttack: An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty.Press: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.",
