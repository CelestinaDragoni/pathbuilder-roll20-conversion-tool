    "description": "You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one lead you're pursuing. Those allies gain the same circumstance bonus you do from Pursue a Lead to checks to investigate that lead. This bonus lasts until you cease pursing that lead or for 1 day, whichever comes first. This doesn't confer any other benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance bonus to your saves with Detective's Readiness.Traits\n\nExploration: An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.",
