It can see invisible creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are concealed. When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check to disbelieve it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to Interact.Traits\n\nEvolution: Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.",
