When you critically hit with a Strike using an unarmed attack that isn't nonlethal, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. This can be because you're taking the penalty to use a fist for a lethal attack or because you have an unarmed attack without the nonlethal trait due to Iron Fists, Tusks, or a similar ability.Traits\n\nOrc: A creature with this trait is a member of the orc ancestry. These green-skinned people tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by orcs. An item with this trait is created and used by orcs.",
