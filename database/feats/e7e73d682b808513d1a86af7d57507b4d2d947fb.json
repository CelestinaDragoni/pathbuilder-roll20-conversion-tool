    "description": "After years of study and careful planning, you finally completed a soul cage to house your soul and successfully performed a ritual to transform yourself into a lich. Now, neither death nor time can prevent you from pursuing your studies and achieving your grand ambitions. You gain the undead trait and the basic undead benefits. Your undead craving is for knowledge.\n\n You gain a unique soul cageâ€”a magic item that houses your soul. Whenever you would die, your soul flees to the soul cage to allow you to be rebuilt. As long as your soul cage exists, you can't truly be destroyed.\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the lich archetype.Lich Dedication Leads To...\n\nBolster Soul Cage, Drain Soul Cage, Enshroud Soul Cage, Hand of the Lich, Spell GemTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.Rare: This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.",
