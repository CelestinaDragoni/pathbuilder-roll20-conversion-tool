    "description": "You sense magical dangers. When using the Detect Magic exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the better result so long as at least one opponent has a magical effect or magic item and is in range of your detect magic.Traits\n\nDivination: The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.\n\nFortune: A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
