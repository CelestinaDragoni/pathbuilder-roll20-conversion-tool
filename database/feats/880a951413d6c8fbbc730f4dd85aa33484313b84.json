    "description": "Carefully etching a sacred image into a physical object, you steel yourself for battle. You can spend 10 minutes emblazoning a symbol of your deity upon a weapon or shield. The symbol doesnâ€™t fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents. Shield The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce more damage with the Shield Block reaction.) Weapon The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.Emblazon Armament Leads To...\n\nEmblazon Antimagic, Emblazon Divinity, Emblazon EnergyTraitsExploration: An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.",
