    "description": "You gain the shall not falter, shall not rout focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings. If you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs and your spellcasting ability is Charisma.\nTraits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nRare: This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.Knights in TrainingSource Legends pg. 68\nThe following feats represent benefits of training from the Iomedars (Kalabrynne for knight vigilant, Clarethe for knight reclaimant, either for Lastwall sentry).\n\nRelated Feats: Rescuer's Press, Vigil's Walls Rise Anew!",
