Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become flat-footed in addition to the effects of the minor curse.\n\n If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can Refocus by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.",
