    "description": "You use your performances to supplement an ally's spellcasting, providing magical energy for their spells. Attempt a Performance check, using a very high DC for the ally's level, and either spend a Focus Point (if the triggering spell is a focus spell) or expend a spell slot at least 1 level higher than the triggering spell. If you succeed at the Performance check, your ally's spell doesn't cost the Focus Point or spell slot.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage canâ€™t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.",
