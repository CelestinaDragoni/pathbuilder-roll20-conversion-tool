    "description": "You draw out the bestial magic energy within your bonded beast gun to fortify yourself, purge ongoing harm, and bolster your life force with a sheath of swirling life essence. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level and attempt a flat check against any ongoing persistent damage, using the DC appropriate for particularly effective assistance. Using this ability depletes the magic within your bonded beast gun, preventing you from using any of its activated abilities until the end of your next turn.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nMagical: Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic.
