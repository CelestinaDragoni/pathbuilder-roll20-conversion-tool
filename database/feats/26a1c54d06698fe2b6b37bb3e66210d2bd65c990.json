When the ally you chose for Courageous Assault critically succeeds at the Strike granted by that action, another ally affected by your inspire courage composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make a melee Strike. Since the second ally wasn't the ally you chose for Courageous Assault, this effect doesn't continue to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds at their Strike.",
