    "description": "You know how to set explosives to cause the maximum possible damage to buildings and other structures. You become trained in Engineering Lore or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You gain the Set Explosives action.\n\n Set Explosives     (concentrate) Requirements You have 1 or 2 bombs in hand; Effect You attach the bombs to an inanimate object within your reach, such as a door, wall, or column, and rig them to detonate at a set time. The bombs explode at a specific time you determine (such as after your next action or at the start of your next turn, to a maximum of 1 minute), dealing their damage and splash damage to the inanimate object. Combine this damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses, and this damage ignores an amount of the object's Hardness equal to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the hazard take the bombs' splash damage, also combined for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. As a reminder, since you didn't throw the bombs, Calculated Splash and similar effects don't apply. Making sure your timing is correct requires concentration, so you can't Set Explosives again while you're waiting for a previously set bomb to detonate.\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the demolitionist archetype.Demolitionist Dedication Leads To...\n\nCollapse Wall, Controlled Blast, Explosive Entry, Safety MeasuresTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.Uncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
