    "description": "You have a vague connection to the Ethereal Plane that enables you to notice spirits. While you're exploring but not Searching, the GM rolls a secret check for you to find haunts that usually require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual essence such as celestials, fiends, and monitors.\n\n You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet of you. This applies while Searching, while Seeking, and on the automatic secret check you gain while exploring even if you aren't Searching. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can't see them if they're more than 5 feet inside an object.\n\n When you notice a creature with your Spiritual Sense, you also learn its location, making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.TraitsDivination: The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.\n\nDivine: This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.",
