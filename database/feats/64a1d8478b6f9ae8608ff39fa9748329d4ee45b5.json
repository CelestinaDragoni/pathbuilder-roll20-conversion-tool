    "description": "You deliver a punishing blow to an enemy's knee, shin, or other vulnerable anatomy within your reach. Make a Strike with one of your melee weapons or melee unarmed attacks. This attack doesn't deal damage. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit. The penalty lasts for 1 round. This penalty applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.Traits\n\nGoblin: A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.",
