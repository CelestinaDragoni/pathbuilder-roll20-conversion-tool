If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. When you Demoralize a foe, if you choose to Demoralize via an elemental display, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.Traits\n\nSuli: Sulis are planar scions descended from jann.",
