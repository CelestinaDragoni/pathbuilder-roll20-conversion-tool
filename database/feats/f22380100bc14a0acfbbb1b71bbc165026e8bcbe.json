    "description": "You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither of you is flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.Visual: A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",
