You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against mental effects that specifically improve your attitude and to your Will DC against someone Coercing you, Demoralizing you, Making an Impression on you, or Making a Request of you.\n\n If a mental effect would compel you to act in a way that violates your Hellknight order’s tenets (as determined by the GM), you can attempt to break free from the effect as a reaction triggered by receiving the violating order, and you gain a new Will save against the effect. You can attempt this new save only once for a given effect, even if you are compelled to violate your order’s tenets multiple times.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.",
