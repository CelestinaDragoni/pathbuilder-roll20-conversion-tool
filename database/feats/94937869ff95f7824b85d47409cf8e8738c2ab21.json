When you make a melee weapon Strike against a foe that has at least two of the following conditions, you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of these conditions the foe has. The qualifying conditions are clumsy, drained, enfeebled, frightened, sickened, and stupefied. If you hit such a foe, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Tumble Through and to perform your style's panache-granting actions until the end of your turn.Traits\n\nRare: This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world.
