    "description": "You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the Perform action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—if the GM sees fit. This action is not a Performance and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to Perform.Uzunjati Storytelling Leads To...\n\nUzunjati RecollectionTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.Skill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill.
