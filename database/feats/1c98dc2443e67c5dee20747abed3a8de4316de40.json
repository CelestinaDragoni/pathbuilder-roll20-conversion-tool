    "description": "You bellow a ferocious call to arms, inspiring yourself to lash out at a foe. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the action is disrupted.Traits\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.",
