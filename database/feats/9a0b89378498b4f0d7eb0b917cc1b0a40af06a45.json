    "description": "You discover the secrets to embedding aeon stones into your flesh. You spend 1 day attuning to an aeon stone and physically embedding it in your skin. While the stone is embedded this way, you gain the benefits of the aeon stone as if it were orbiting above your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. Aeon stones in your flesh must be invested to function, as usual.\n\n You can also use this activity to safely remove an embedded aeon stone in 1 day. Someone without this feat can attempt to surgically remove it safely by spending 1 day and succeeding at a DC 30 Medicine check, or hastily by simply ripping it from a corpse.Embed Aeon Stone Leads To...\n\nAeon ResonanceTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDowntime: An activity with this trait takes a day or more, and can be used only during downtime.Skill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill.
