    "description": "You know more about the habits of devils than is entirely safe. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against devils and saving throws against their abilities. In addition, whenever you meet a devil in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.\n\nSpecial If you have the Glad-Hand skill feat, you don’t take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a devil.Traits\n\nHuman: A creature with this trait is a member of the human ancestry. Humans are a diverse array of people known for their adaptability. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by humans.\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
