While you are in this stance, you constantly have your shield raised as if you'd used the Raise a Shield action, as long as you meet that action's requirements.Traits\n\nStance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",
