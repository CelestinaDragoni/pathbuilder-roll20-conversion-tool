This doesn't expend a use of Turn to Mist, and you can use Mist Escape even if you've already Turned to Mist in the same day. You take move actions to move directly toward your coffin even though you are at 0 HP, though you aren't conscious and don't have control over how you do so. While at 0 HP in this form, you are unaffected by further damage. You automatically return to your corporeal form, unconscious, if you reach your coffin or after 1 hour when you are destroyed, whichever one comes first.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.",
