You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks against non-humanoid intelligent creatures and against humanoids that are marginalized in human society (at the GM's discretion, but typically at least including giants, goblins, kobolds, and orcs). You also gain this bonus on Perception checks to Sense the Motives of such creatures.\nTraits\n\nHalf-Orc: A creature with this trait is part human and part orc. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by half-orcs.",
