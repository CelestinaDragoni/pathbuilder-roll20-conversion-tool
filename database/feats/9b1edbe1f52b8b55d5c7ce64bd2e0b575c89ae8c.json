These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the backswing, forceful, grapple, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes.

A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you canâ€™t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",
