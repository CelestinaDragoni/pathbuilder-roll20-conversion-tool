Choose Deception or Diplomacy. You become trained in that skill, or become an expert if you were already trained.\n\n Choose two cantrips from the occult list; each cantrip must be from either the enchantment or illusion school. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and can cast these spells as occult innate spells. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the captivator archetype.Captivator Dedication Leads To...\n\nBasic Captivator Spellcasting, Effortless Captivation, Heightened Captivation, Look Again, Reactive CharmTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.",
