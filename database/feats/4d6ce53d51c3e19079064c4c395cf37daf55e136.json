    "description": "No one can react faster than you can pull your trigger. When using your initial deed, instead of Interacting to draw a weapon, you can Strike with a firearm or crossbow you're already wielding. If this Strike hits, the target is also flat-footed until the end of your first turn of the encounter.\n\nSpecial If your initial deed allows you to Interact to draw a weapon more than once, this feat allows you to replace one of these Interact actions and use the other one to draw a weapon. You can't replace both Interact actions with Strikes, but you can draw a loaded firearm or crossbow with one of the actions and immediately shoot it with the other.",
