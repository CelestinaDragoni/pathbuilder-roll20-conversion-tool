    "description": "You purify a spirit by coaxing it to release its anguish in a final cathartic howl. This deals sonic damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a basic Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you expend a spirit wisp, this deals 1d4 sonic damage per level you have. If you expend a spirit remnant, this deals 1d6 sonic damage per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nEvocation: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.Sonic: An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to powerful sound.",
