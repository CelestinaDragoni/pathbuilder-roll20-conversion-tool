    "description": "You tie yourself to the Material Plane by implanting a piece of your consciousness into a weapon, piece of armor, or other item that's precious to you. As long as this object is intact, even if your body is destroyed, you can be restored to the exact state you were in the last time you made daily preparations with this object in your possession. The soulbound object can be used as a special focus for raise dead, resurrect, or similar magic. This warps the spell to bring you back in your skeletal undead state rather than bringing you back to life. Pharasma can't prevent you from returning when the spell is modified in this way.\n\n When you return, you permanently lose a memory that was precious to you, in addition to any other side effects of the spell that brought you back. Your soulbound object becomes inert until you spend 1 week of downtime to anchor yourself to it again, further fragmenting your mind.Traits\n\nNecromancy: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.\n\nSkeleton: This undead is made by animating a dead creatureâ€™s skeleton with negative energy.Uncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.",
