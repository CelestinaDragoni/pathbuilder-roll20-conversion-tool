    "description": "You’ve spent enough time on fire that you know how to use it to your advantage. You can light yourself thoroughly on fire with a held torch, a bottle of alchemist’s fire, or a similar incendiary, dealing yourself 1d6 persistent fire damage. As long as you are suffering persistent fire damage, all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully Grapples, Shoves, or Trips you takes 1d6 fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead. You must still attempt the flat check to remove the persistent fire damage each round, as normal.Torch Goblin Leads To...\n\nScalding SpitTraitsGoblin: A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.",
