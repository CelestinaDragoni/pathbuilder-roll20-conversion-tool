If it's night and you can see the stars, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering roll.Traits\n\nFortune: A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.\n\nLizardfolk: These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.",
