    "description": "A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent. Make a melee Strike against a foe. The foe must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC.\n\nSuccess The target is unaffected.\nFailure The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It's stunned 1 and its speech is raspy and hard to understand. It must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to use linguistic actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the end of its next turn.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the creature is stunned 3 instead of stunned 1.Traits\n\nIncapacitation: An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.\n\nRage: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.",
