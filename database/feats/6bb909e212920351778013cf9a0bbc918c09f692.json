During your daily preparations, choose a single crossbow or firearm. Until your next daily preparations, you can use the Call Gun action to call the gun to your hand.\n\n Call Gun     (conjuration, magical) Effect You hold aloft a free hand and call the firearm or crossbow you chose during your daily preparations into your hand. As long as the weapon you chose is on the same plane, it appears in your hand.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nConjuration: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the conjuration school of magic, typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation, or moving things from place to place.Magical: Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.\n\n Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.Teleportation: Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another.
