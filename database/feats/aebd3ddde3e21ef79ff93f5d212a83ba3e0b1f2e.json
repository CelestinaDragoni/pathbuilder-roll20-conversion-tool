    "description": "Your spotter's quick signals help you make even difficult shots seem simple. As long as both you and your spotter can see the target of your attacks, you don't take a penalty for attacking within your weapon's second range increment. The penalty you take for firing into further range increments is –3 for the third range increment, with an additional –2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the third (–5 for the fourth range increment, –7 for the fifth, and –9 for the sixth).Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.Visual: A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",
