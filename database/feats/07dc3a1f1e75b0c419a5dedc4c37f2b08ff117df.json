You gain the trained proficiency rank in Thievery (or another skill of your choice, if you’re already trained in Thievery). If you roll a success on a Thievery check to Pick a Lock, you get a critical success instead.Traits\n\nHalfling: A creature with this trait is a member of the halfling ancestry. These small people are friendly wanderers considered to be lucky. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by halflings. A weapon with this trait is created and used by halflings.\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
