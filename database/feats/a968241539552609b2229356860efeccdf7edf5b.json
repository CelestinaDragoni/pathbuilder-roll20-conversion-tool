    "description": "You've sacrificed a piece of your spirit, allowing the powers of shadow into your being and changing the nature of your magic. You can no longer cast spells that have the light trait; if an ability, such as a class feature or ancestry feat, would automatically grant you a light spell, such as the Domain Initiate feat granting you the dazzling flash spell, you don't gain that spell.\n\n You gain the cloak of shadow domain spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the Refocus activity. You can Refocus by meditating to siphon power from the Shadow Plane and refill your focus pool. Your domain spells from the shadowcaster archetype are of the same tradition as the spells you used to meet the shadowcaster archetype's prerequisites.\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the shadowcaster archetype.Shadowcaster Dedication Leads To...\n\nDisciple of Shade, Shadow Reservoir, Shadow Spell, Shadow Spells, Unending EmptinessTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nDedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.Uncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
