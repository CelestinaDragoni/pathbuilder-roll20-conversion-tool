In addition to using Devise a Stratagem to modify a Strike, you can use it to modify a Disarm, Grapple, Shove, or Trip attempt, substituting your Devise a Stratagem roll for the Athletics check. You must apply the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether it's a Strike or one of the Athletics actions.\n\n You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you're using a weapon for the maneuver and the weapon doesn't fit the restrictions for using Intelligence with a stratagem.",
