    "description": "You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. When you use Medicine to Administer First Aid, instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's frightened or sickened condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nHealing: A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.Manipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage canâ€™t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.Skill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
