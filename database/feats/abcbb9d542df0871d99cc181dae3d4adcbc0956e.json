If the trigger was a skill check, you instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers). If the trigger was an effect with the misfortune trait, the misfortune and fortune effects cancel each other out as normal, negating the triggering misfortune effect.Traits\n\nAphorite: A type of planar scion descended from a being from Axis, the Plane of Law.\n\nFortune: A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
