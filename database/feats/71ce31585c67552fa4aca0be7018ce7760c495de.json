You Interact to reload your hand crossbow and Strike with it.\n\nSpecial If you have the Repeating Hand Crossbow Training feat, you can use this feat with a repeating hand crossbow to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage canâ€™t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.",
