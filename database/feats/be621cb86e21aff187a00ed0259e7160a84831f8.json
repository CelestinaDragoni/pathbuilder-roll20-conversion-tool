    "description": "You have a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn underneath your outer garment. You can change into this disguise to Impersonate as a 3-action activity. If you have master proficiency in Deception, it is instead a 2-action activity, and if you have legendary proficiency, it is a single action. You can create a new backup disguise by spending the normal amount of time it takes you to Impersonate, but you can have only one backup disguise at a time. Having a backup disguise doesn’t allow you to remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready, it’s possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements of the disguise (see Conceal an Object in the Stealth skill).Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nSkill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.Uncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.Firebrand OptionsSource Character Guide pg. 71 2.0\nThe Firebrands use a variety of unorthodox equipment and techniques to achieve their goals, whether those goals include drawing attention, or subterfuge and subtlety. The following Firebrand options are uncommon, and members of the Firebrands gain access to them once they reach the rank of second mark. The Entourage feat is rare even for members of the Firebrands, as it requires a certain degree of fame and in-world activity to acquire, and potentially requires the player or GM to keep track of additional background NPCs. Typically, only third mark and fourth mark Firebrands have the notoriety and social influence required to maintain an entourage. While Firebrands seek to build an entourage more than most adventurers, it’s not unreasonable for any famous character to gain access to it if the players are interested in playing with the Entourage feat.\n\nRelated Feats: Entourage, Sow Rumor",
