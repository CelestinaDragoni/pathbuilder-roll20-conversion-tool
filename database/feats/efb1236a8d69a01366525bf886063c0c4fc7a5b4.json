The attacker must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become stupefied 1 for 1 round (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).Traits\n\nMental: A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.\n\nPoppet: Small constructs originally designed to serve as companions or servants. They occasionally gain a greater spark of life, transforming them into independent, sapient creatures.",
