    "description": "Your nails are supernaturally long and sharp. You gain a nails unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your nails are in the brawling group and have the agile and unarmed traits. You can etch your nails with runes with the same cost and restrictions as for etching runes onto handwraps of mighty blows; runes etched onto your nails apply to nails unarmed attacks with both hands but not to other unarmed attacks.\n\n You can deliver hexes through your nails. When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 actions or more to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a nails Strike against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.",
