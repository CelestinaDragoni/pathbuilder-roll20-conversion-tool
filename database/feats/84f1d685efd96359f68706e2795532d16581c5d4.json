You can reroll the triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than the first roll.\n\nSpecial You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.Traits\n\nDuskwalker: A creature with this trait has the duskwalker versatile heritage. Duskwalkers are planar scions infused with the supernatural energy of psychopomps. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by duskwalkers.\n\nFortune: A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
