    "description": "Your final blow can make an impact even if it rebounds off a foe’s defenses. Make a Strike with the required weapon. After the Strike, your turn ends. The Strike deals one extra weapon damage die, or two extra weapon damage dice if you’re at least 18th level. The Strike also gains the following failure effect.\n\nFailure You deal damage equal to one weapon damage die of the required weapon. Increase this to two dice if you’re at least 18th level.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.TraitsPress: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.",
