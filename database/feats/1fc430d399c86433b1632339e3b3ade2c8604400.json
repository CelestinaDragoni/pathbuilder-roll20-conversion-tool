You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Maneuver in Flight and can combine two maneuvers into a single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 5. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you can combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites.
