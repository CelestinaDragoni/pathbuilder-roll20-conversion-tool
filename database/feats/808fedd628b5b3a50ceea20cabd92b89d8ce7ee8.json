You and all allies within 30 feet gain a +10-foot status bonus to all Speeds for 1 minute.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.Transmutation: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing somethingâ€™s form.",
