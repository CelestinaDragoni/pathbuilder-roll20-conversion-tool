You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed while you've manifested your wings.Celestial Wings Leads To...\n\nEternal Wings (Aasimar)TraitsAasimar: A creature with this trait has the aasimar versatile heritage. Aasimars are planar scions descended from celestial beings. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by aasimars.\n\nDivine: This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.Morph: Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).\n\nYour morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.Transmutation: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing somethingâ€™s form.",
