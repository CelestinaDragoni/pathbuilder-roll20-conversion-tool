    "description": "You aim your weapon to snag a foe's armor, clothing, or flesh to pull them closer. Make a melee Strike. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can move it 5 feet toward you. When you move the creature, you can move the same distance in the same direction as it, even if you're adjacent to the target. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. \n\nThis Strike has the following failure effect.\n\nFailure The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn.Traits\n\nPress: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.",
