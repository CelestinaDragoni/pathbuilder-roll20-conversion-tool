    "description": "You strike magical tones that can turn the tide of combat. You and your allies within 30 feet gain the effects of one of the following runes until the end of your next turn: corrosive, disrupting, flaming, frost, ghost touch, shock, or thundering. The effects apply to a single weapon the creature is holding or one of the creature's unarmed attacks. You choose the rune and the effect applies to all creatures. You can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the duration of the rune for 1 additional round up to a maximum of 1 minute. If this would give a weapon or unarmed attack more property runes than its normal maximum, an existing property rune (as the creature chooses) is suppressed until the spell ends.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.Evocation: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.",
