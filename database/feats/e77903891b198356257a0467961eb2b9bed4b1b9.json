    "description": "You go to extreme lengths to support your allies, even when it means bringing harm to yourself. If your next action is to cast harm or heal from your healing or harmful font to restore Hit Points to a single ally, you can channel your own vitality along with the spell. You lose 1d8 Hit Points per level of the spell, which can't be reduced or mitigated in any way, and your ally regains an equal number of Hit Points.Traits\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
