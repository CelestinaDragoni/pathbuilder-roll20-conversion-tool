    "description": "Time spent tending to your own form has unlocked your ability to fix other things. You can cast 1st-level mending once per day as an arcane innate spell. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level. Even though you're alive and not an object, and you can't normally recover Hit Points from effects that repair objects (like the Repair skill), you can target yourself with this innate spell and use it to recover Hit Points.Traits\n\nPoppet: Small constructs originally designed to serve as companions or servants. They occasionally gain a greater spark of life, transforming them into independent, sapient creatures.",
