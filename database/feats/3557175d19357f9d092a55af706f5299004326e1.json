    "description": "Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAura: An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, affecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item or a creature with a strong alignment.Olfactory: An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",
