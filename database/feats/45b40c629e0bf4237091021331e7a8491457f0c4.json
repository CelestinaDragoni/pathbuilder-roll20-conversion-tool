If you've damaged the target within the last minute with the same weapon and you get a critical success on your attack roll, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or die; this is a death and incapacitation effect. A creature that survives is temporarily immune for 1 day. Creatures with no head (such as dullahans or oozes) are immune to this ability, and creatures with redundant heads (such as ettins) might survive the destruction of a head.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.",
