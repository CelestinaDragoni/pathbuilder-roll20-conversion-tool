    "description": "You know the wilderness so well that you can help your party travel through it with ease. When you are setting the path for your party through wilderness terrain, your party gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for the purpose of calculating the party's travel speed, your party's travel speed doesn't decrease in difficult terrain, and greater difficult terrain halves your party's travel speed instead of reducing it to a third. This doesn't increase your party's Speed during an encounter or allow your party to ignore difficult terrain during an encounter.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nSkill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
