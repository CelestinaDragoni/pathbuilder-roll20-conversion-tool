On a critical success, the target is also stunned 1 and can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 hour, and if you are on your home plane and the target is a fiend of level 18 or lower from another plane, it is also banished to its home plane. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this attack.TraitsUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
