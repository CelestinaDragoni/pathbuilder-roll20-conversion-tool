Other than taking the form of an elemental instead of an animal, this familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars.\n\n Your familiar gains one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following elemental familiar abilities. While your familiar has an elemental familiar ability, your familiar is composed of the associated elemental matter and gains the matching elemental trait. You can't select more than one elemental familiar ability at a time. Air If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes invisible until it next takes an action.
