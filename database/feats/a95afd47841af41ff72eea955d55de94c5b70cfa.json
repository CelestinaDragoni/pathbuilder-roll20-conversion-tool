You can spend one hour resting to rehydrate your gills and skin, which counts as submerging your body in water. At the GM's discretion, incredibly dry areas, such as deserts, might not have enough moisture in the air for your Rehydration to work.Traits\n\nAzarketi: Amphibious humanoids who live among the seas of the Inner Sea region, said to have descended from the people of Azlant. Sometimes known as gillmen or Low Azlanti.\n\nAzarketis craft and use these weapons.\n\nPrimal: This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct.
