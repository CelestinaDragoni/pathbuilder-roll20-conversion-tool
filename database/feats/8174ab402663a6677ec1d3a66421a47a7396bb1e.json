    "description": "Through study of multiple magical traditions, you've altered a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a magical tradition other than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or a spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you're a cleric or druid, for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally. You can cast this cantrip as a spell of your class's tradition.\n\n If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate tradition or a different one.\nAdapted Cantrip Leads To...\n\nAdaptive AdeptTraitsHuman: A creature with this trait is a member of the human ancestry.
