You can breathe normally in areas of ash and smoke without risk of suffocation, and you ignore the concealed condition from smoke. You need only a successful DC 10 flat check to recover from persistent fire damage, rather than DC 15 (and the DC when receiving particularly effective assistance is 5 instead of 10).",
