When you prepare your spells for the day, you can choose one spell slot at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast and prepare two spells in that slot. When you Cast a Spell from that slot, choose which spell to cast. Once you've chosen, the unused spell dissipates as though you hadn't prepared it at allâ€”for example, it isn't available for use with Drain Bonded Item.",
