This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.\n\nSpecial This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, natural, or occult).Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes.
