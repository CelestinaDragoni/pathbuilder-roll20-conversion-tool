    "description": "With superior engineering and magical application, you have freed your signature vehicle from the bonds of gravity, allowing it to soar through the sky like a dragon. The vehicle gains magical propulsion and a fly Speed equal to its fastest current Speed. If your signature vehicle already had a fly Speed, reduce the distance the vehicle needs to make a 90-degree turn to half the usual length (typically half the length of the vehicle).Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nMagical: Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.\n\n Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.",
