You disguise your true meaning behind other words and phrases, relying on subtle emphasis and shared experience to convey meaning that only your allies understand. Any allies who have traveled alongside you for at least 1 full week automatically discern your meaning. Other observers must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must critically succeed to understand the message itself.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites.
