    "description": "You fire your gun while throwing off a target's balance with your melee weapon. Then, you topple your foe to the ground with the quick orchestrated combination. You don't need to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and eliminating your target's movements and options, leaving them no choice but to fall.\n\n Make a ranged firearm Strike against a creature within the reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a Performance check against the creature's Reflex DC. If the Strike critically succeeds, the target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its Reflex DC against this check. The Performance check has the following effects.\n\nCritical Success The target falls and lands prone. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.\nSuccess The target falls and lands prone.\nCritical Failure Your plans backfired on you, and you're forced to drop your melee weapon in your space.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.",
