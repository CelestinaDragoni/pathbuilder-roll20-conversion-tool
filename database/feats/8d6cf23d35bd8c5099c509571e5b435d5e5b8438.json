Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the Glad-Hand skill feat against other sprites, without taking a â€“5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.Traits\n\nSprite: A family of diminutive winged fey with a strong connection to primal magic.",
