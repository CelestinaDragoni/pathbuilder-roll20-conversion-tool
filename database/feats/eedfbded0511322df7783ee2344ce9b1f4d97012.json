    "description": "The blood of the Dragon Kings runs strong in your veins. Your draconic heritage is clearly visible, with hair that is almost entirely crimson, azure, or the like, and that shines like a dragonâ€™s scales. You can cast the dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell as an innate arcane spell once per day, but you can use only the dragon breath that is associated with your heritage and that matches the energy type of your Dragon Spit feat. At 12th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened by an additional spell level.Traits\n\nHuman: A creature with this trait is a member of the human ancestry. Humans are a diverse array of people known for their adaptability. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by humans.",
