Flinging your body into a twisting somersault, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against the triggering attack. If the attack still hits you, you can Step to an open space that's still within the triggering enemy's reach, turning the impact of the blow into momentum.Traits\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.\n\nSwords TrainingSource PFS Guide pg. 119\nMarcos Farabellus (Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide page 50) is a talented swordsman and likely the most beloved of the Society's three deans. In addition to teaching his students about the dangers of exploring ruins through energetic and performative lectures, Farabellus also teaches his favorite students a few of the martial techniques he's developed over his illustrious career. The Farabellus Flip is a class feat for barbarians, fighters, or rangers. When you select the feat, it loses the traits from the other classes.\n\nRelated Feats: Discerning Strike",
