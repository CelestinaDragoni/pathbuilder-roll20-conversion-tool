    "description": "You slam your hands together to unleash a deafening blast. Creatures in a 15-foot cone cone take 3d6 sonic damage, with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. Creatures that critically fail their save are also deafened for 1 minute. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds as your hands recover from the thunderous vibrations.\n\n At 8th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage from Thunder Clap increases by 1d6.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nSonic: An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to powerful sound.Black Powder FeatsSource Pathfinder #178: Punks in a Powderkeg pg. 55\nIf the characters agree to Nixbrix's challenge to defeat Bitey or otherwise impress the gang leader, he offers to teach them a few tricks. The characters gain access to the feats in the Black-Powder Berserkers section on page 79, even if they aren't from Alkenstar or the Mana Wastes, though they still must meet the feats' other prerequisites to take them.\n\nRelated Feats: Black Powder Flash, Inured to Alchemy, Pain Tolerance, Powder Punch Stance",
