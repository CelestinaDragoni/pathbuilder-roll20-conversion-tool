The beast parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. Then, make a dynamo Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
