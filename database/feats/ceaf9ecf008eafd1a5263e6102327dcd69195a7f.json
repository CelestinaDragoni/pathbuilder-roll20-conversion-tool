    "description": "If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition and it’s a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can’t get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 10 if you’re legendary. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure.\n\nCritical Success You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.\nSuccess You correctly recognize the spell.\nFailure You fail to recognize the spell.\nCritical Failure You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM’s choice.Recognize Spell Leads To...\n\nQuick RecognitionTraitsGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites.
