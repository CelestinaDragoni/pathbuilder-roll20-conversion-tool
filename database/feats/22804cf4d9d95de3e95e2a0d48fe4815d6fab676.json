    "description": "With a complex gesture, you focus the divine power of your spell to overcome enemies' resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance equal to your level against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the positive energy within a field of life. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.TraitsManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
