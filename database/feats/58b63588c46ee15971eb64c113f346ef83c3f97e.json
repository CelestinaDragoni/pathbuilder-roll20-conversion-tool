If you would automatically become trained in Performance (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.\n\n You gain the Impressive Performance feat. When you attempt a Performance check to Make an Impression on an elf, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.Traits\n\nHalf-Elf: A creature with this trait is part human and part elf.
