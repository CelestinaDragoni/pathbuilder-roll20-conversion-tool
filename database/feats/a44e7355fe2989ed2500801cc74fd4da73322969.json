    "description": "Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won't search, you're skilled at keeping the object on the move so it's never where they look. When you Conceal an Object of light Bulk or less, you can use Thievery instead of Stealth for your checks and for the DC of an active searcher's Perception check. You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nSkill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
