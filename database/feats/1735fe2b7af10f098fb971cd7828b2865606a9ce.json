If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from you (or 20 feet, on a critical failure) and fall prone. If another creature or physical object would prevent this movement, both your target and the blocking creature or object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet of movement that was prevented.",
