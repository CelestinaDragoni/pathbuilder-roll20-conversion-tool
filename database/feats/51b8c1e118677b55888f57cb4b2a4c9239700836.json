    "description": "In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about a person's origin and history. You might notice bits of green under the person's fingernails and determine they're an herbalist, a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn't learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire. \n\nSpend 1 minute in the presence of someone you haven't met before, or haven't met since you first gained Biographical Eye, then attempt a DC 30 Society check. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you learn about their false biography rather than their true one unless the result of your Society check exceeds their Will DC.\n\nCritical Success You learn the creature's profession, their specialty within that profession, and a major accomplishment or controversy from their career. You also learn the nation and settlement where they live, as well as the district in a city large enough to have districts. In addition, you learn the nation or settlement where they spent their formative years.\nSuccess You learn the creature's profession and specialty within that profession. You learn the nation or settlement where they normally live.\nFailure You learn the creature's profession and the region of the world they hail from, but no more.\nCritical Failure You learn a piece of erroneous information about the creature.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nSecret: The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.Skill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
