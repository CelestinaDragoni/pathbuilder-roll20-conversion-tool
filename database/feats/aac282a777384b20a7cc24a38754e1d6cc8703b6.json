It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites.

A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat.
