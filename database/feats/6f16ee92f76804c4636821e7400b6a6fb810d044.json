    "description": "As you use your magic to manipulate air or water, you divert some of its currents to form a barrier around you. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with the air or water trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC or a +2 circumstance bonus against ranged attacks. This effect has the air or water trait, or both, depending on the traits of the spell you cast. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saves against effects with the air trait, water trait, or both until the start of your next turn, depending on the spell's traits.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.TraitsAbjuration: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the abjuration school of magic, typically involving protection or wards.\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
