If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to Trip the creature you hit.

Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes.
