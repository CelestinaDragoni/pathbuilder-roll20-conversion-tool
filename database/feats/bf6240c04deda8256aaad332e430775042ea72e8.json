    "description": "You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms. Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as “Danger assassin flee” or “Meet me moonrise”). Your intended listener can attempt a Perception check to discern the message (DC 20 if an ally, DC 15 if a halfling ally, DC 10 if a halfling ally with Folksy Patter). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to Sense Motive apply.Traits\n\nHalfling: A creature with this trait is a member of the halfling ancestry. These small people are friendly wanderers considered to be lucky. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by halflings. A weapon with this trait is created and used by halflings.",
