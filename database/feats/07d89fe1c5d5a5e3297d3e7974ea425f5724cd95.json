The object must be your size or one size smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk for you to lift it in the first place. Make a ranged Strike with the object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same amount of damage it would deal on a success. The object is a simple ranged weapon that deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage, has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon trait. The damage increases to 2d10 if you have weapon specialization in simple weapons, or 3d10 if you have greater weapon specialization.Traits\n\nRage: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.",
