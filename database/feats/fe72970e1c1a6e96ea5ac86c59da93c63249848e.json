    "description": "You attempt to counteract the triggering spell using powerful magical techniques observed in the Kortos Mounts. Use your attack roll modifier with your shield or parrying weapon for your counteract check. If you counteract the spell, it is reflected upon the caster. If the spell targeted individual creatures, it targets the caster only. If the spell targeted an area centered on a point, the new area is centered on the caster. If the spell was a cone or line, the cone or line emanates from you toward the caster. If the spell has a save DC, it uses your class DC, and if it requires a spell attack roll, use the same attack roll modifier as the counteract check.TraitsUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.\n\nCapstone FeatsSource Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet pg. 72\nCharacters who have reached 20th level can choose from the following feats, representing the pinnacle of mortal power influenced by their triumphs.\n\nRelated Feats: Annihilating Swing, Astonishing Explosion, Banishing Blow, Denier of Destruction, Endurance of the Rooted Tree, Mimic Protections, Reclaim Spell, Ringmaster's Introduction, Steal Essence, Tenacious Blood Magic, Verdant Presence",
