If this Strike hits, the weapon rebounds toward an enemy within 10 feet of the original target. Make an additional Strike against this second target. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both attacks.Traits\n\nFlourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.",
