You immediately gain the effects of the Sustain a Spell action, which you can use only to extend the duration of an enchantment or illusion spell.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
