    "description": "Your eidolon blocks attacks against you. After your eidolon uses this action, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. This bonus applies only while you're within your eidolon's reach (in most cases, this means your eidolon is adjacent to you or in your space).Traits\n\nEidolon: A creature with this trait is a summoner's eidolon. An action or spell with this trait can be performed by an eidolon only. An item with this trait can be used or worn by an eidolon only, and an eidolon can't use items that don't have this trait. (An eidolon can have up to two items invested.)\n\nEvolution: Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.",
