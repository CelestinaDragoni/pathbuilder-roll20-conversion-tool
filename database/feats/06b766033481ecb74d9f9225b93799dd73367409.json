    "description": "You control your breathing and align it with your ki, exhaling with controlled force in order to overcome your opponent's resistance. If you use your next action to Cast a Spell that has the monk trait and no duration, the spell and any Strikes you make as a result of casting it ignore an amount of the target's resistance to physical damage equal to your level.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
