    "description": "You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed Strike with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a â€“2 status penalty to saving throws against curse effects for 1 hour.\n\nSpecial The damage die for your clay fist is 1d8, and it loses the agile and finesse traits of a typical fist.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nCurse: A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. \n\nAfflictions with this trait are manifestations of potent ill will. A curse either lasts a specified amount of time or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. A curse with stages follows the rules for afflictions.
