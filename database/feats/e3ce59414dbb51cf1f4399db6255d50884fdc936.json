    "description": "You've attuned your core to allow you to phase in and out of the Astral Plane, allowing you to teleport periodically. You can cast dimension door once per hour as a 4th-level innate arcane spell.\n\nEnhancement Your attunement allows you to teleport in a series of quick jumps rather than in one big leap. You can expend your hourly use of dimension door as a free action when you begin your turn. If you do, your Strides are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with your Speed instead of traversing normally to the location. While augmented, your Strides gain the conjuration and teleportation traits. Your augmented Strides don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square, unless those reactions trigger on teleportation.Traits\n\nAutomaton: Automatons are living constructs sustained by a magical core.",
