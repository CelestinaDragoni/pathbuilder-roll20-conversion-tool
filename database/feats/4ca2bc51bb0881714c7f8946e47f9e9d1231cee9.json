Choose one common 2nd-level spell from the same tradition as an innate spell you previously gained from another elf ancestry feat (from the arcane list if you have Otherworldly Magic, for example). You can cast that spell as an innate spell once per day, using the same tradition as the list you chose the spell from.\n\n Your magic is adaptable. By spending 1 day of downtime, you can change the spell you chose to a different common 2nd-level spell from the same tradition.Traits\n\nElf: A creature with this trait is a member of the elf ancestry. Elves are mysterious people with rich traditions of magic and scholarship who typically have low-light vision. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by elves.
