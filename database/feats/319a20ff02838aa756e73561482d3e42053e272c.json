Make two Strikes, one each against two separate targets. The targets must be adjacent to each other and within your weapon's maximum range. Each of these attacks takes a â€“2 penalty to the attack roll, but the two count as only one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.Traits\n\nFlourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.",
