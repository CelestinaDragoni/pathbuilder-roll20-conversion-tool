    "description": "You know how to make the best and most efficient use of a hunted animal's carcass. Choose a Large or larger corpse of an animal that died within the past day. While using Survival to Subsist near the carcass, you always receive enough food for yourself and one additional Medium creature, using up the meat from the carcass to do so. Since you're using all of the animal, others can't use the carcass's meat for any other purpose, including their own use of All of the Animal.TraitsGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nSkill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat.

She is happy to teach what she knows to any characters who display a similar reverence toward living creatures, such as by peacefully resolving their encounter with the giant porcupine in Chapter 1 of this adventure. Although this feat is particularly useful to characters who want to recruit animal followers throughout the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, it isn't strictly necessary for the party to succeed in their adventures. It can be a great boon to parties taking part in other quests, as well.\n\nRelated Feats: Spirit Speaker, Tame Animal",
