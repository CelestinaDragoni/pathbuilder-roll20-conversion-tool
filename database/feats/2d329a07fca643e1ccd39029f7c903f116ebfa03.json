    "description": "You perform complex manipulations to make the energy from your spells so powerful that your enemies remain vulnerable to it afterward. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that deals acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you can select one target that was damaged to gain weakness 5 to that damage type until the end of your next turn. If a spell deals multiple types of energy damage, choose one that the target gains weakness to. This has no effect on creatures with resistance or immunity to the energy type you choose.Traits\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
