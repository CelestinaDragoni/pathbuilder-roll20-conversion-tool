You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps.

If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes.
