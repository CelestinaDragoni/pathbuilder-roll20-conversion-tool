    "description": "You provide preventative remedies and care to help your patient fight off future maladies. You Treat a Condition the target doesn't yet have, naming any condition you could normally treat with Treat Condition. The counteract check gains the secret trait, so the GM rolls it secretly. The next time within the next minute the creature would be affected by that condition, your treatment immediately attempts to reduce the condition value with the effects of Treat Condition, using the secret roll result for the check. Preventative Treatment lasts on a creature for 1 minute, until the treatment is used, or until you use Preventative Treatment again on that creature, whichever comes first.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nSecret: The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.Uncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.",
