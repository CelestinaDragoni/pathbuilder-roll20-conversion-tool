The target must reroll the triggering saving throw and use the worse result.Traits\n\nCatfolk: A creature with this trait is a member of the catfolk ancestry. Catfolk are humanoids with feline features. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by catfolk. An item with this trait is created and used by catfolk.\n\nDivination: The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.Misfortune: A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.Occult: This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.",
