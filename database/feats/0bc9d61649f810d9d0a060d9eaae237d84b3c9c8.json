    "description": "Your plant form sprouts hundreds of spines, and your blood causes mild hallucinations in creatures exposed to it. Each time a creature touches you, hits you with an unarmed attack, or hits you with a melee weapon attack while adjacent to you, that creature takes 1d6 piercing damage. Increase the damage to 2d6 if the polymorph spell is 8th level or higher, or to 3d6 if it’s 10th level.\n\n When an adjacent creature damages you with piercing or slashing damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or become stupefied 1 (or stupefied 2 on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn.\n\n These benefits last until you’re no longer polymorphed into a plant.TraitsMorph: Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).\n\nYour morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.Katapesh PoisonersSource Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad pg. 78\nFamous not only for its pesh cash crop and the host of medicinal plants that grow naturally in the nearby desert, but also for the consistent demand for efficient toxins, Katapesh has developed its own specialized poisons and toxic techniques. The city's infamous Poison Maker's Guild is the source of many of these concoctions as well as secret techniques for using them, though unscrupulous Katapeshi bodyguards, thieves, and assassins all know at least one poison recipe or a unique means of inflicting such toxins.\n\nRelated Feats: Deadly Poison Weapon, Shaped Contaminant",
