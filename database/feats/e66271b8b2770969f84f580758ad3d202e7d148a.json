    "description": "You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor and movements to reduce the noise you make. When you wear non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to Stealth checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). If you're a master in Stealth, reduce the penalty by 2, and if you're legendary, reduce the penalty by 3. If your armor has the noisy trait, instead of reducing the penalty to Stealth checks, you ignore the effects of the noisy trait, enabling you to remove the penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.\n\nSkill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
