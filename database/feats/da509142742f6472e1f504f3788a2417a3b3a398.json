    "description": "You can use your wayfinder to store a little extra magic for when you need it most. When making your daily preparations, you can choose one 1st-level spell from your spellbook or spell repertoire and store it in your wayfinder. You can cast this spell from the wayfinder using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your wayfinder.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nSpells TrainingSource PFS Guide pg. 119\nSorrina Westyr (Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide page 46) took up the mantle of dean of the school of Spells to replace her predecessor Aram Zey, who had originally been her replacement. When Aram Zey was lost to the magic of the extradimensional demiplane known as the Hao Jin Tapestry, Sorrina began teaching an advanced studies course in extradimensional and interplanar phenomena, hoping to both prevent future losses and better prepare her students for the unexpected challenges that may await them in their careers as Pathfinder agents.",
