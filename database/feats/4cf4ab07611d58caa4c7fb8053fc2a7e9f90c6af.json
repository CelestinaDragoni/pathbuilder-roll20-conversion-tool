    "description": "There's no longer a limit on how many temporary spell slots you can gain per day from wellspring magic.\n\nSpecial You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the wellspring mage archetype.Wellspring Mage Dedication Leads To...\n\nInterfering Surge, Urgent Upwelling, Wellspring ControlTraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nClass: Archetypes with the class trait fundamentally diverge from your class's specialties but still fit within the theme of your class.\n\n You can select a class archetype only if your class meets the criteria listed in the archetype's prerequisites. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer.\n\n It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class. If you select this ability, you must take that archetype's dedication feat at 2nd level, and you proceed normally afterward. You can never have more than one class archetype.Dedication: You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.Rare: This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.",
