    "description": "During your daily preparations, you can magically fuse a shield into your favorite book, where it appears as an elaborate bookmark. While the two are fused, the book shares the Hardness, Hit Points, and Broken Threshold of the shield, and it can be used to Shield Block if you have that reaction, with a requirement of “You have Raised the Tome” instead of the usual requirements.\n\n You can switch the fused item's form from a book to a shield with a book-shaped motif as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. When the item is in book form, you can read the book and Raise the Tome, and when it's in shield form, you can Raise the Shield, Activate it, and gain any other benefits or effects the shield normally has (such as a spellguard shield's bonus to saving throws against magic). The fusion lasts until your next daily preparations.Traits\n\nArcane: This magic comes from the arcane tradition, which is built on logic and rationality. Anything with this trait is magical.\n\nTransmutation: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.",
