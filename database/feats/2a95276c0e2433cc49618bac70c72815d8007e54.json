When you Aid an ally who is trying to Create a Diversion, instead of the usual effects of Aid, you can roll a Performance check and use that result to determine the outcome of the diversion, instead of the ally rolling a Deception check.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites.
