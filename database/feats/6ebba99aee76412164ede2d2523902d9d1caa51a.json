    "description": "You use your shield in tandem with an ally's, forming a barricade. Both you and the triggering creature have standard cover as long as you remain adjacent to each other and you both have your shields raised; when this is no longer the case, the effect ends. You and your ally can't use this cover to Hide, as it's obvious you're standing there holding your shields, but you and your ally can use it to Take Cover. Normally, if you and your ally don't move, Shield Wall lasts until the beginning of your next turn, when your shield is no longer raised.Traits\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
