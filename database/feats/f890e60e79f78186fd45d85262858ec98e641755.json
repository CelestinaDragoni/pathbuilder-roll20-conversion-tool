    "description": "Your firsthand experience of the subjective nature of time and space has given you new observational insights. Your mind processes information so quickly that time appears to stop for all creatures but you. You can take up to 9 actions in 3 sets of up to 3 actions each. During this time, you can use purely mental and observational abilities such as Recall Knowledge, Seek, and Devise a Stratagem, and you can use an action to move a mental projection of yourself to a location within a 60- foot radius to observe objects more closely and from different angles, though you can't affect your surroundings in any way (for instance, you could move your mental projection more closely to a distant door to read a minute inscription on its handle, but you could not open it to observe the other side). When the duration elapses, time resumes its normal flow.TraitsUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.\n\nCapstone FeatsSource Pathfinder #168: King of the Mountain pg. 75\nPlayer characters can select one of the following new class feats for their 20th-level class feat upon entering the Glass Lighthouse or by meditating on the cushion in area H4.\n\nRelated Feats: Dance of Intercession, Demon's Hair, Everdistant Defense, Extradimensional Stash, Head of the Night Parade, Heart of the Kaiju, Plum Deluge, Ruby Resurrection, Scapegoat Parallel Self, Sever Space, Time Dilation Cascade, Vitality-Manipulating Stance, Vivacious Afterimage, Whirlwind Toss, Worldsphere Gravity",
