In the case of an area effect, if your Sneak doesn’t move you out of the area, both you and the decoy are targeted by the effect.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait.
