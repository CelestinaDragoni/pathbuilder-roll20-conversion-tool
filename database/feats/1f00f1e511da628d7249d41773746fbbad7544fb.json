    "description": "You've spent many an evening learning songs and tales featuring calacas, death's wandering minstrels. You dramatically unleash a stunning blast of sound by smashing an instrument you hold or belting out a discordant note. This has the effects of synaptic pulse, but the effect is auditory rather than mental. The DC is either your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.Traits\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.\n\nDivine: This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.Duskwalker: A creature with this trait has the duskwalker versatile heritage. Duskwalkers are planar scions infused with the supernatural energy of psychopomps. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by duskwalkers.Enchantment: Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.Incapacitation: An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
