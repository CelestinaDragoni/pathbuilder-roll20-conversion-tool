    "description": "Your spell shrouds you in a billowing cloud. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that targets you, you surround yourself in a 15-foot emanation of dense magical mist that lasts until the start of your next turn. All creatures within the cloud become concealed, and all creatures outside the cloud are concealed to creatures within it.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
