With a successful DC 8 flat check, you can accurately recall a sound or a snippet of conversation you heard within the last week. You are memorizing by rote rather than content, and can't use this to cram facts, so this doesn't grant you any extra ability to Recall Knowledge.Traits\n\nShisk: Secretive humanoids covered in bony plumage that reside underground.",
