    "description": "Born of a blood hag, a fiery blood drinker hidden behind a false skin, you have one blood-red eye and the ability to slough off your appearance in an instant. You gain the Lie to Me skill feat, and you can shed a disguise quickly by peeling off the outer layer of your skin. Changing from a disguise used to Impersonate back to your true appearance is a 3-action activity for you; if you're an expert in Deception, it's a 2-action activity, and if you're legendary in Deception, it takes only a single action. This doesn't allow you to don or remove armor or other equipment any faster, but your physical appearance otherwise returns to its normal state.Veil May Leads To...\n\nInvoke the ElementsTraitsChangeling: A creature with this trait has the changeling versatile heritage.
