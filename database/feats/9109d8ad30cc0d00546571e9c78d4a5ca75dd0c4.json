    "description": "Your mask holds the legacy of Black Heron, the Wings of Knowledge, who united the aeromancers of the Shory Empire. You can harness residual magical power to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only you, your fly Speed doubles until your next turn.TraitsArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nRare: This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.Masks of the Magic WarriorsSource Pathfinder #174: Shadows of the Ancients pg. 78\nIn becoming Jatembe's new Magic Warriors, the heroes have unlocked secrets of magical potential that none have reached since the earliest Ten Magic Warriors walked the plazas of the Magaambya.\n\n On reaching 20th level, the heroes should have the option of taking one of these archetype feats, based on the type of animal they chose for their mask when they first created it in Pathfinder Adventure Path #169: Kindled Magic. These options are each themed to one of Jatembe's magic warriors, but if a hero's mask doesn't fit with a specific animal from this list or the player feels their animal embodies a different effect from the list, feel free to reflavor the feat names to fit the hero's spirit face. For instance, the Cunning Trickster mask could easily be a rodent or a fox, not just a spider.\n\nRelated Feats: Cunning Trickster Mask, Emancipator's Mask, Grand Medic's Mask, Protective Spirit Mask, Stalking Feline Mask, Storyteller's Mask, Thick Hide Mask, Tireless Guide's Mask, Vigilant Mask",
