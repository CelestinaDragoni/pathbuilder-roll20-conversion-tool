    "description": "You hang onto a foe to harry them into submission. If your target moves while you're hanging onto it, you can choose to move with the target. The target is released if you choose not to move with it, at the start of your next turn, or if the target Escapes. Attempts to Escape from a Cling follow the rules for Escape, but use your Acrobatics DC and end the Cling instead of the conditions normally ended by the Escape action.\n\nSpecial You can use this action without a free hand if your preceding Strike was made with your jaws or a similar unarmed attack you could use to hang on. The GM determines which unarmed attacks apply. Hanging on in this way prevents you from using that unarmed attack.Traits\n\nGoblin: A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.",
