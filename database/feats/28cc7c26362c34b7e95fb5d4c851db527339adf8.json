If you hit and deal damage and the result of your attack roll exceeds the target's Perception DC, you Steal a small object from the target (as if you had succeeded at that task using the Thievery skill). Depending on the object, the target might realize that it has been stolen, and onlookers might realize you have stolen the object if the attack roll doesn't exceed their Perception DCs.\nTraitsFlourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait.
