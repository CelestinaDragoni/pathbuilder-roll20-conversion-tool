    "description": "Your skin glows with intensity. Creatures within 10 feet who can see you must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.\n\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected.\nSuccess The creature is dazzled for 1 round.\nFailure The creature is blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 4 rounds.\n\nCritical Failure The creature is blinded for 4 rounds and dazzled for 10 minutes.\nTraits\n\nFire: Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.\n\nIfrit: Ifrits are planar scions descended from efreet.Incapacitation: An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.Light: Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.Visual: A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",
