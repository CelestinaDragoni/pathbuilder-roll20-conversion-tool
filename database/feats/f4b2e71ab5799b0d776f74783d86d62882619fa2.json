    "description": "You attempt a dizzying blow. Make a melee Strike. If you hit, your foe must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC with the following results; the save has the incapacitation trait.\n\nCritical Success The target is unaffected.\nSuccess The target can't use reactions until its next turn.\nFailure The target is stunned 1.\nCritical Failure The target is stunned 3.Traits\n\nFinisher: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use any actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.\n\n Some actions that have the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.",
