    "description": "You stare into your target's eyes and enthrall them, shattering their free will. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level dominate as a divine innate spell, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. It gains the visual trait. At 18th level, the dominate is heightened to 8th level; at 20th level, it's heightened to 9th level. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to your domination for 24 hours, though in most cases, you can't Cast the Spell again within 24 hours. If you are destroyed, all your dominate spells from Dominating Gaze immediately end.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
