During your turn, you can cast one spell your familiar knows that was granted by your patron's theme or lessons without spending a spell slot to do so (or even having it prepared). The spell must be at least 1 level lower than your highest-level witch spell slot.\n\nSpecial This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).",
