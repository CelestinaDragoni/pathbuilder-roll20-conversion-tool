    "description": "You're renowned for your ability to recover important items, whether they're from a long-abandoned temple or a thieves' den, and sometimes that requires creating a stand-in. You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nSkill: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
