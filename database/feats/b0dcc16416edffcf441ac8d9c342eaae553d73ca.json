While in this stance, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against reactions triggered by using actions with the concentrate or manipulate traits. In addition, when you cast a spell that requires one or more actions while in this stance, your unarmed Strikes gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nStance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you canâ€™t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",
