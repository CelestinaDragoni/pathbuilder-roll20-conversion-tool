    "description": "Your peri lineage has opened your mind to fire's raw, purging essence. You can spend 1 minute in focused preparation, then enter a fire your size or larger to instantly teleport to any fire that is your size or larger up to 5 miles away. You take no damage from entering or exiting fires when using this ability. Once you enter the fire, you instantly know the rough locations of other large fires within range and can exit from the original fire, if you prefer. You can't carry extradimensional spaces with you when you teleport; if you attempt to do so, the activity fails.Traits\n\nAasimar: A creature with this trait has the aasimar versatile heritage. Aasimars are planar scions descended from celestial beings. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by aasimars.\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.Divine: This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.Exploration: An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.Fire: Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.Manipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage canâ€™t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.Teleportation: Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.",
