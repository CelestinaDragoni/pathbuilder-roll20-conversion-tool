    "description": "You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can Cast the Spell a second time before the end of your next turn without expending a spell slot.Archetype Use\n\nThis feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.TraitsConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nMetamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spellâ€™s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
