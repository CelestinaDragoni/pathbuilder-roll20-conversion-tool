When you draw a rib, you lose 2 HP, and the projectile deals 2 extra negative damage if you Strike with it before the end of your next turn. The HP loss and extra damage both increase to 3 at 12th level and 4 at 19th level. Your rib cage magically replenishes, and any rib you draw crumbles to dust after being used for a Strike or at the end of your next turn, whichever comes first.Traits\n\nSkeleton: This undead is made by animating a dead creatureâ€™s skeleton with negative energy.",
