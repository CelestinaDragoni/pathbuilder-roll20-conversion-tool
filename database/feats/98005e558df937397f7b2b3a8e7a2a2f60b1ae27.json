As long as you and an ally are adjacent to each other, neither of you can become flat-footed due to flanking unless both of you are flanked. If you're adjacent to more than one ally, all eligible allies can benefit at a given time. The benefit is negated for everyone if at least you and any one eligible ally are flanked, but not if your allies are flanked and you aren't.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.",
