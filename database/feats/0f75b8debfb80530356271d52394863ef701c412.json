    "description": "With a resounding cry, you rally your ally to the offensive. Choose one ally within your marshal's aura who has a reaction available. If you spend 1 action, that ally can use their reaction to immediately Stride. If you spend 2 actions, that ally can use their reaction to immediately Strike.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.\n\nAuditory: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.Flourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.",
