Until the item takes damage again, you can still use it as a shoddy item of its type. This repair restores no Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is Repaired normally such that it is no longer broken, it is also no longer shoddy.Traits\n\nGeneral: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.",
