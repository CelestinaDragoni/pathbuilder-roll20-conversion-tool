    "description": "You dart towards your opponent, seeking to stab them and slice their purse-strings with a single movement. Stride up to your Speed; this movement does not trigger reactions triggered by movement. At any point during this movement you can Strike an opponent within reach. If this Strike is successful, you can attempt a Thievery check to Steal from the target.Traits\n\nUncommon: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.\n\nPerilous LarcenySource PFS Guide pg. 118\nPirate captain Stella Fane (CN female human privateer; Lost Omens Character Guide 119) joined the Pathfinder Society as a venture-captain as part of a deal to help the Society make it through the heavily armed naval blockades of Port Peril's Free Captains. Cunning and competitive, Stella's greatest weakness as a leader of the Society is her uncompromising hatred of the Chelaxian government. Those who can avoid ending up sunk or executed by Chelaxian naval commanders while assisting Stella may leave with a few more tricks than they had before seeing the skilled pirate in action. Fane's Fourberie and Stella's Stab and Snag, below, are class feats that rogues or swashbucklers can select. When you select either feat, it loses the trait from the other class.\n\nRelated Feats: Fane's Escape, Fane's Fourberie",
