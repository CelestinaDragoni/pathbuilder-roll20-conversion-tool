    "description": "You've learned to move your spiritual energy past yourself to attack spirits where others can't. You can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within your reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring you to succeed at a DC 11 flat check when you target it. You can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If you do, the next melee Strike you make this turn requires you to succeed at only a DC 6 flat check to affect the creature.Traits\n\nArchetype: This feat belongs to an archetype.",
