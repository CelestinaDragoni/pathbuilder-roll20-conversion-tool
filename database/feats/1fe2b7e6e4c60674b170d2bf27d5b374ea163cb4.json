    "description": "You can cast your spells effortlessly by tapping into the leylines of the world. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don’t expend the prepared spell as you cast it.Traits\n\nConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nManipulate: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
