Your obviously fiendish traits disappear, including any tails, horns, and cloven hooves, though hints remain (claws turn into jagged nails or eyes retain an odd hue, for instance). You're still recognizably yourself, but now appear as a typical, non-tiefling member of your base ancestry. Using Devil in Plain Sight counts as creating a disguise when using Deception to Impersonate, and your transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine if you're a normal member of your base ancestry; only creatures actively rolling Perception to examine you might notice the disguise. While in your shapeshifted form, you can't use unarmed attacks, innate spells, or other abilities that require physical features you receive from a tiefling ancestry feat\u2014for instance, you can't use the Skillful Tail feat. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and can shift back to your tiefling form by using this action again.Devil in Plain Sight Leads To...\n\nFinest TrickTraitsConcentrate: An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.\n\nDivine: This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.Polymorph: These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.\n\n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.Tiefling: A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage.
